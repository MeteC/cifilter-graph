cifilter-graph
==============

A Mac tool for chaining together CIFilters from the CoreImage framework in a graphical fashion, tweaking their settings and seeing the results on the fly. Should be useful for anyone tweaking their own CIFilter chains..

March 2014: Graph connections starting to look better. Still using the 3 functional node-graph-views, but as soon as connections can be made with the mouse this thing will take off with leaps and bounds, as a vast majority of CIFilters can be represented already by the system and are just waiting their turn..

July 2013: Early days yet - Although the concept is simple, the GUI will likely take far more work than the actual implementation. So far 3 ugly looking node-graph-views are set up and functional, but have no connection capability for more than just input/output image, nor tweakable settings.
